This project is an implementation of a simple text adventure, as laid out the [project specification](https://studres.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/2020_2021/CS2006/Practicals/H1/H1.html). Namely:
* The code stubs in `Actions.hs` have been implemented.
  * Movement between rooms is possible.
  * `get`, `drop`, and actions have been implemented.
  * Helper commands, including a general `?` (beyond the specification), have been implemented.
* The game world has been extended.
  * A living room, bathroom, and porch have been added (see `img/Map.png`).
  * New puzzles were added:
    * Glasses need to be collected and worn before the text prompts can be read properly.
    * You need to brush your teeth in the bathroom before you can have your morning coffee.
    * You need to put your mask on before you can leave the porch.

In terms of team organisation, we had regular meetings to pick out new tasks and targets, which were then added to Microsoft Planner to keep track of progress. Between meetings, people would assign tasks to themselves and complete them, and intermediate progress reports could be added to the task in Planner to further break down the work if needed, or avoid two people doing the same thing. The provided submission is a Git repository, so precise breakdown of lines of code written can be found by running `git log` or `git blame` (note though that commit identities have not been anonymised -- they contain names and email addresses instead of matriculation numbers).

Instructions for running the game can be found in `README.md`. Instructions to complete the game can be found in `CHEAT.md`.
